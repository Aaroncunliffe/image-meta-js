TESTS - Want that passing logo
DOCS - docs logo? 


Testing with mocha

Why?
Lots of research and experimentation.
Following and creating a program from complicated technical documentation.

Personal use - Photography as a hobby, want to extract metadata including camera settings
and lens profiles


Why not use one of the other solutions?
- I wanted to be able to define the interface to use
- Flexibility, I have the ability to expand this to RAW files
- I find this interesting
